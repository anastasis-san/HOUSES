           <p class="left">Welcome to a World of Hidden Homes! Perhaps here, behind winding streets and quiet doors, you will find the house you have been dreaming of. Soft light filters through forgotten windows, and every room whispers stories yet untold. Walk slowly, listen closely — each corner holds a secret, each hallway leads to possibilities. Some homes appear only to those who truly dream.</p>

           <p class="right">Whether you seek a refuge in the mist, a warm hearth in the shadows, or a place where memories linger in the walls, you might discover it here. Explore the unseen, follow the fog, and let your imagination wander. Your dream home may not be found on the first glance — but perhaps, here, it waits for you.</p>

          <img src="bw.jpg" alt="bw" class="bw-img" />
          <p class="bw-text">Here, houses are more than walls and windows.
          They remember footsteps, whispers, late-night thoughts, and early morning dreams.
          Each door opens not only into a room — but into a feeling.
          Maybe you are looking for a place to disappear.
          Maybe for a place to begin again.
          Maybe for a corner where time slows down and memories gently stay. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text">
          <h3>THEY ARE WAITING FOR YOU!</h3>
          <p>The houses breathe and the walls remember everything, carrying echoes of footsteps long gone and whispers that almost sound like names you know, while windows watch silently, catching your shadow before you even realize it and floors shift beneath you as if the house itself were alive, moving subtly in response to your presence, rooms stretching and bending when you are not looking, hallways winding longer than they should and staircases leading somewhere you did not expect, yet in the quiet fog there is always the possibility of finding a home that has been waiting for a lifetime, a place where memories linger in the corners and secrets rest beneath the floorboards, a dwelling that somehow knows you and welcomes you even before you are ready to belong, leaving you uncertain whether you are the one who has found the house or if the house has chosen you.</p>
